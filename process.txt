Process: An instance of a program (eg. Python interpreter)

+ Takes advantage of multiple CPUs and cores
+ Seperate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
+ Great for CPU-bound processing
    (CPU Bound processes are ones that are implementing algorithms with a large number of calculations. 
    They can be expected to hold the CPU for as long as the scheduler will allow. 
    Programs such as simulations may be CPU bound for most of the life of the process.)
+ New process is started independently from other process
+ Process are interruptable/killable
+ One GIL for each process, avoids GIL limitation

- Heavyweight
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- More memory
- IPC (inter-process communication) is more complicated
